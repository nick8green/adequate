/**
 * App based metrics can be registered here. The register needs to be imported and then any metrics can be registered
 * using the `registerMetric` method.
 *
 * For example, to register a metric named `theMetric`, you can do the following:
 * ```
 * import { register } from '@shared/metrics';
 *
 * // Add app specific metrics here
 * register.registerMetric(theMetric);
 * ```
